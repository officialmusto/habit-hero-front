## Limitations
### We are committed to providing a flawless user experience; however, the current version of Habit Hero has a few limitations:

- **Error Handling**: 
We are actively working on enhancing error handling on the backend to ensure that errors from the frontend are effectively handled via the database, resulting in a smoother user experience.

- **Habit Tracking Functionality**: While the app performs CRUD operations efficiently, it does not fully support habit tracking functionality at the moment. We are diligently working on implementing robust tracking features, enabling users to monitor the status of their habits and track their progress effectively.

- **Underutilized Database Information**: We acknowledge that not all the information provided by the database is being fully utilized. Our team is working diligently to leverage the available data effectively and provide enhanced features and insights to our users.

- **Documentation and Testing**: We are aware that documentation comments are missing for functions and other code blocks. Additionally, a dedicated codebase for testing functionality is not currently available. We recognize the importance of comprehensive documentation and testing and are actively addressing these areas.

## Upcoming Features & Next Steps
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: We are focused on refining the backend's error handling capabilities to effectively address and handle frontend errors, ensuring a seamless and error-free user experience.

- **Robust Habit Tracking**: Our team is working tirelessly to implement robust habit tracking features. This will empower users to monitor their habit progress, gain valuable insights, and make data-driven decisions on their habit-building journey.
- **Expanded CRUD Operations**: We plan to expand the existing CRUD operations to include more entities and retrieve additional information from the database. This will enable users to customize their habits further, tailoring them to their specific needs.
- **Dedicated Testing Environment**: We are in the process of setting up a dedicated testing environment to rigorously test the functionality of functions and other code blocks. This will ensure the reliability and stability of the Habit Hero app.
